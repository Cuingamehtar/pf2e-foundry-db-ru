Uncontainable power explodes from your spectral dragon. Your Channel Draconic Essence ends, and all creatures (except you) in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10] from your spectral dragon take @Damage[(5+floor((@item.level - 4)/2))d6|options:area-damage] damage with a @Check[reflex|against:class-spell|basic|options:area-effect] save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. The damage's type matches the breath of your draconic benefactor. You then can't use Essence Overflow again for [[/gmr 1d4 #Recharge Essence Overflow]]{1d4 rounds}.

At 8th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d6.
