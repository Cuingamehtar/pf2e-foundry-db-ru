Thanks to your draconic blood, there are no mountains or hills you can't surmount. You gain a climb Speed of 20 feet; if you already have a base climb Speed, it increases by 5 feet. You also gain the [[Способности/Боевой альпинист]] skill feat, even if you aren't trained in Athletics. If you choose a draconic exemplar, you must choose a dragon with a climb Speed.
