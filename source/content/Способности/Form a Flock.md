title: Form a Flock

You call nearby wild dragonets to swarm to your side. The flock grants you 25 temporary Hit Points that last up to 1 minute. The flock disperses and the effect ends when the temporary Hit Points are gone, the minute elapses, or you Dismiss Form a Flock. As long as you're surrounded by your flock, you gain weakness 5 to area and splash damage and have a flock aura in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10]. Enemies in this aura are [[Состояния/Ослеплён]].

When you use Form a Flock and while it lasts, you can take the Acrid Barrage action.
