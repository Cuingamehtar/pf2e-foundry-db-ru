You're able to channel more of your draconic benefactor's power and focus it into your [[Способности/Дыхание кобольда]], increasing its effectiveness but requiring more time to recover. When you use Kobold Breath, you can increase the damage dice to d8s and increase the area to @Template[cone|distance:30]{30 feet for a cone} or @Template[line|distance:60]{60 feet for a line}. If you do, you can't use Kobold Breath again for 1 hour. During this time, Kobold Breath cannot be recharged using Kobold Momentum.
