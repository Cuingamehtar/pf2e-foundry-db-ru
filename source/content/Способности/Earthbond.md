Your bond to the terra firma under your feet increases as your connection to your draconic aspect grows. You can ignore difficult terrain caused by stone (such as rubble or gravel) and uneven ground made of stone and earth. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to [[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.lOE4yjUnETTdaf2T]] or [[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.7blmbDrQFNfdT731]] you. This bonus also applies to saving throws against spells or effects that attempt to force you to move.
