You form a close bond with a companion, similar to that of a master and familiar, that lets you gift them with a touch of your inherent magic. You can spend time with another player character during your daily preparations to make them your designated companion for that day. That player must have a Focus Point pool. You gain the [[Действия/Fortify Focus]] activity.
