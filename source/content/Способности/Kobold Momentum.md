You possess the confidence of a dragon, and your success emboldens you to draw on power reserves you didn't know you had. You recharge your Kobold Breath whenever you score a critical hit with a Strike. In addition, if you score a critical hit with a Strike and then use your Kobold Breath on the same turn, you can reroll any 1s on the damage dice. You must use the new result, even if it's a 1.
