You've become the champion of the runelords of envy. Their support gives you a heightened awareness of your own failings, but you can call their spirits to your side to protect you from harm. The first time each day you critically fail a skill check or saving throw, you gain 1 Mythic Point. You gain the [[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.OHzBFzMQp7MLlk5W]] activity.
