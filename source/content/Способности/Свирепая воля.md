**Частота:** Раз в час

**Триггер:** You succeed at a saving throw against a magical mental effect.

---

You send a blast of magical feedback at the effect's source, dealing @Damage[ceil(@actor.level/2)d6[mental]] damage with a @Check[will|against:class-spell|basic|options:inflicts:slowed] save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If the target critically fails, it's also [[Состояния/Замедлен|Slowed 1]] for 1 round. At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d6.
