Your scales are hard as armor, ensuring you always have some protection in the dangerous world. When you're unarmored, your scales give you a +1 item bonus to AC with a Dexterity cap of +3. The item bonus increases to +2 at 5th level. The item bonus to AC from these scales is cumulative with armor potency runes on your [[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.dDIPA1WE9ESF67EB]], the [[Заклинания/Мистический доспех]] spell, or [[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.02q8s6sSicMkhs1l]].
