You gain the service of a young riding drake, riding dragonet, or another animal companion with the dragon trait you have access to. Your bond with your dragon companion lets you communicate and issue commands to it telepathically with a range of 100 feet. You must still use the [[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.q9nbyIF0PEBqMtYe]] action to direct it but don't require words or gestures to do so.
