**Триггер:** A creature in your reach that you're aware of attempts to [[Действия/Разоружить]] you, or damage or [[Действия/Украсть]] an item in your possession.

You are protective of your hoard, and woe betide anyone who tries to take what's yours. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the triggering action was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.
