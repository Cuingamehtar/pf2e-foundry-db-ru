Your dragon's constant breath threatens your foes. While in this stance, your dragon companion has an aura in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:5]. Each creature that starts its turn in the aura takes the damage listed under the dragon's support benefit with a basic Reflex save against your mount's Athletics DC.
