Your blood surges with the might of dragons who master the waters, and you can move freely in their domain. You gain a swim Speed of 15 feet; if you already have a base swim Speed, it increases by 5 feet. You can hold your breath underwater for 10 minutes before needing air, and you take only a –1 circumstance melee penalty to slashing or bludgeoning attacks that pass through water (instead of –2). If you choose a draconic exemplar, you must choose a dragon with a swim Speed.
