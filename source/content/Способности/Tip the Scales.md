You're a cunning adversary in close quarters and are well-versed in hit-and-run tactics that exploit the advantages of your small stature. As part of your training, you learned what to do when you're [[Состояния/Схвачен]] or [[Состояния/Сдерживаем]]. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Escape, and after resolving a successful Escape action, you can immediately use your reaction to Step or to [[/act shove]] or [[/act trip]] the creature from whom you just Escaped.
