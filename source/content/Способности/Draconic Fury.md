You briefly summon spectral claws that lash out in a flurry. All creatures in a @Template[type:cone|distance:15] take @Damage[(1 + floor(@item.level/4))d6[slashing]|options:area-damage] damage with a @Check[reflex|against:class-spell|basic|options:area-effect] save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. A creature that critically fails the save also takes @Damage[(floor(@item.level/4))d4[persistent,bleed]] damage. If you are Channeling Draconic Essence, your spectral dragon's space can be the origin of the cone.

At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the initial damage increases by 1d6 and the persistent bleed damage on a critical failure increases by 1d4.
