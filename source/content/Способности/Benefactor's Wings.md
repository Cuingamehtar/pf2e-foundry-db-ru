Calling on your draconic gift, spectral wings carry you to your destination. You Fly. If you don't normally have a fly Speed, you gain a fly Speed of 20 feet for this movement. If your spectral dragon shares your space, this fly Speed is instead 30 feet, and your spectral dragon moves with you. If you aren't on solid ground at the end of this movement, you fall.
