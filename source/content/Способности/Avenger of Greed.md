You've become a champion of the runelords of greed. Their whispers encourage you to prepare for disasters that might never come to pass. The first time each day you touch an object worth at least 2,000 gp that you've never touched before, you gain 1 Mythic Point. You gain the [[Действия/Convocation of Greed]] activity.
