Energy reminiscent of dragon scales shimmers over you, making it more difficult for attacks to penetrate your defenses. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to AC and gain resistance equal to half your level to bludgeoning damage. If you are [[Действия/Channel Draconic Essence|Channeling Draconic Essence]], you can grant these benefits to a willing creature who is in the same space as your spectral dragon instead of you.
