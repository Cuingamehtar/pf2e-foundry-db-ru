Your breath causes lasting hindrance to those it harms. Creatures who fail their saves against your [[Способности/Дыхание дракона [Драконья кровь]|Breath of the Dragon]] gain one of the following conditions, based on the damage type of your breath: [[Состояния/Неуклюжесть|Clumsy 1]] (electricity, cold, fire, or sonic damage), [[Состояния/Ослаблен|Enfeebled 1]] (acid, physical, or poison damage), or [[Состояния/Одурманен|Stupefied 1]] (force, mental, spirit, vitality, or void damage). The condition lasts until the end of your next turn.
