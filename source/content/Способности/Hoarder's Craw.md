Your draconic features include a pouch inside your body that you use to store food prior to digestion. However, instead of swallowing rocks or other minerals to help grind your food, you swallow gold and other precious ores for the same purpose. Inside your craw, you can store up to 100 coins (of any type) or an amount of precious material that's light Bulk (usually a chunk). Items can be [[Состояния/Скрыт]] inside your craw or regurgitated as an Interact action. Instead of precious material or coins, you can also use your craw to conceal an item of light Bulk but can only do so for up to 1 hour before you must regurgitate it. While carrying anything other than precious material or coins in your craw, you become [[Состояния/Неуклюжесть|Clumsy 1]] due to the discomfort.
