**Эффект:** Spend 1 Mythic Point. The spirits of four runelords of wrath (Angothane, Xiren, Thybidos, and Alaznist) swirl around you for 1 minute. While the spirits remain, whenever you hit or critically hit with a Reactive Strike, the target takes an additional 5 spirit damage, or 10 spirit damage if the target of your Reactive Strike is Xanderghul, the Runelord of Pride.
