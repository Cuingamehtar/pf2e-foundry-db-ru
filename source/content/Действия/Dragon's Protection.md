**Триггер:** An enemy you can see would reduce this spell's target to 0 Hit Points

---

**Эффект:** The dragon intercepts, preventing the spell's target from being knocked out; the spell's target remains at 1 Hit Point. As the dragon disappears, it flies over the triggering enemy and releases its retributive breath, dealing @Damage[5d4[spirit]] damage to it with a @Check[reflex|basic] save.
