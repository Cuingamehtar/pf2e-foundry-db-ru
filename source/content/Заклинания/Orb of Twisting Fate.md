**Критический успех:** Существо невредимо.

**Успех:** At the start of its turn, the target must decide whether to spend its first action to Stride in a random direction or to spend its first action doing nothing. The spell then ends.

**Провал:** As success, but instead of ending automatically, the target attempts a new save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

**Критический провал:** As success, but instead of ending automatically, the spell lasts for the full duration.
