**Область:** (continued) two 30-foot cones

Like a vorpal dragon, you absorb life with an inhale and release it with an exhale. All living creatures in the first cone take 5d6 void damage with a basic Fortitude save. You and all living creatures in the second cone regain Hit Points equal to the greatest damage a single creature took from the first cone.

**Усиление (+1):** The damage and healing increase by 1d6.
